			<p2> One of my all time favorite quotes <br> </p2>

			<pre>
				<i>"Each day the professional understands, 

				he will wake up facing the same demons, 

				the same Resistance, 

				the same self-sabotage, 

				The difference is that now

				he will not yield to those temptations.

				He will have mastered them 

				and will continue to master them"</i>
